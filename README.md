# Connect The Dots (CTD):: A Generative Model for Modular Perturbation Detection
An R package for probabilistic estimation of multivariate feature sets against a partial correlation network.

## Installation
In R, install the devtools package, and install CTD by install_github(“BRL-BCM/CTD”).


## Look at the Driver Script
The driver script is called “main_CTD.r”. It will take you across all the stages in the analysis pipeline, including:

1. Permutations generation
2. Calculate minimum encoding length
3. Calculate patient similarity, based on mutual information.
