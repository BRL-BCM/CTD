#' @description Untargeted metabolomic analysis for the clinical screening of 
#' inborn errors of metabolism. Global metabolic profiling obtained by 
#' untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomic platform for the detection
#' of novel and known inborn errors of metabolism.  This untargeted approach 
#' collected z-score values for ~1200 unique compounds (including 
#' ~500 named human analytes) from human plasma.  Data set contains 
#' 186 individual plasma samples (118 confirmed inborn errors of
#' metabolism).  The outcome describes excellent sensitivity and 
#' specificity for the detection of a wide rage of metabolic disorders 
#' and identified novel biomarkers for some diseases.
