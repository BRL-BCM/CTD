#' @title A metabolomic map of Zellweger spectrum disorders reveals novel disease biomarkers.
#'
#' @description Global metabolic profiling obtained by untargeted mass spectrometry-based
#' metabolomic platform for the detection of novel and known inborn errors of
#' metabolism.  This untargeted approach collected z-score values for >650 unique
#' compounds from human plasma.  Data set contains 19 individual plasma samples with
#' confirmed biallelic pathogenic variants in the PEX1 gene. These samples revealed
#' elevations in pipecolic acid and long-chain lysophosphatidylcholines, as well as
#' an unanticipated reduction in multiple sphingomyelin species.
