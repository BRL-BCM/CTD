#' @description A metabolomic map of Zellweger spectrum disorders reveals 
#' novel disease biomarkers. Global metabolic profiling obtained by 
#' untargetedmass spectrometry-based metabolomic platform for the 
#' detectionof novel and known inborn errors of metabolism.  This 
#' untargeted approach collected z-score values for >650 unique compounds 
#' fromhuman plasma.  Data set contains 19 individual plasma samples with
#' confirmed biallelic pathogenic variants in the PEX1 gene. These 
#' samples revealed elevations in pipecolic acid and long-chain
#' lysophosphatidylcholines, as well as an unanticipated reduction
#' in multiple sphingomyelin species.
