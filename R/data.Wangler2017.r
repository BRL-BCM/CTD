#' @description A metabolomic map of Zellweger spectrum disorders reveals 
#' novel disease biomarkers. Global metabolic profiling obtained by untargeted
#' mass spectrometry-based metabolomic platform for the detection
#' of novel and known inborn errors of metabolism.  This untargeted 
#' approach collected z-score values for >650 unique compounds from
#' human plasma.  Data set contains 19 individual plasma samples with
#' confirmed biallelic pathogenic variants in the PEX1 gene. These 
#' samples revealed elevations in pipecolic acid and long-chain
#' lysophosphatidylcholines, as well as an unanticipated reduction
#' in multiple sphingomyelin species.
